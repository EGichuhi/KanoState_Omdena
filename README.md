# Omdena Smart Farming Project

**Smart Farming using AI for Sustainable Agriculture in Kano State, Nigeria**

## Overview
The Omdena Smart Farming Project leverages artificial intelligence to revolutionize agricultural practices in Kano State, Nigeria. By integrating AI with real-time data from sensors, satellite imagery, and weather forecasts, this project aims to empower local farmers with data-driven insights for improved crop management, efficient resource utilization, and sustainable farming practices.

## Features
- **AI-Powered Analytics:** Deploy machine learning models to forecast crop yield, predict pest outbreaks, and optimize irrigation schedules.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Combine data from various sources (sensors, satellite imagery, weather data) to provide actionable insights.
- **Sustainable Farming Practices:** Promote techniques that enhance soil health, reduce chemical use, and minimize environmental impact.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Utilize IoT devices for continuous monitoring of environmental conditions and crop health.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Offer a user-friendly interface for farmers and stakeholders to visualize data, access recommendations, and monitor project progress.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages:** Python, JavaScript
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, PyTorch
- **Data Handling:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Plotly, Dash
- **IoT Integration:** Raspberry Pi, Arduino (as applicable)
- **Cloud Platforms:** AWS, GCP, or Azure for scalable data storage and processing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Software:** Python 3.8+, Node.js (for front-end components if applicable), Git
- **Hardware:** Compatible IoT devices for real-time data collection (optional)

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/omdena-smart-farming.git
   cd omdena-smart-farming
   ```
2. **Set up a virtual environment and install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **(Optional) Set up the front-end:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

### Data Processing & Model Training
